# deep_learning_final_project

This is our deep learning final project code! The goal of our project was to use Graph Convolutional Networks for Single-Cell Classification. You can find our data preprocessing steps in data_preprocessing.py, our model class creating in gcn.py, and the actual training of our model in model.py.
